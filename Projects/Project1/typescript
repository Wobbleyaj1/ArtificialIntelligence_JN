Enter a positive number of chips for piles A B C: 3 3 4

The number of chips in each pile initially:
A: 3    B: 3    C: 4

Type 0 if you want the MACHINE to start, and 1 if YOU want to start: 0
I take 1 chip(s) from pile C.
The number of chips in each pile after the computer moves is:
A: 3    B: 3    C: 3

Enter the pile letter (A, B, C) and the number of chips to remove: A 3

The Human will take 3 chip(s) from pile A.
THE NUMBER OF CHIPS IN EACH PILE NOW:
A: 0    B: 3    C: 3

I take 1 chip(s) from pile C.
The number of chips in each pile after the computer moves is:
A: 0    B: 3    C: 2

Enter the pile letter (A, B, C) and the number of chips to remove: C 1

The Human will take 1 chip(s) from pile C.
THE NUMBER OF CHIPS IN EACH PILE NOW:
A: 0    B: 3    C: 1

I take 3 chip(s) from pile B.
The number of chips in each pile after the computer moves is:
A: 0    B: 0    C: 1

Enter the pile letter (A, B, C) and the number of chips to remove: C 1

The Human will take 1 chip(s) from pile C.
THE NUMBER OF CHIPS IN EACH PILE NOW:
A: 0    B: 0    C: 0


The winner is: The Machine
