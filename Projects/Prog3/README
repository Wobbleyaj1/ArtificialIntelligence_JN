The Chatbot class is defined, which loads responses from a file and provides methods for responding to user input.

The load_responses method reads response data from a file named responses.txt. Each line in the file should contain keyword(s) followed by a colon and response(s) separated by commas.

The respond method processes user input, finds the first occurring keyword(s), and selects a response associated with the keyword(s).

Various helper methods (format_input_text, find_keyword_positions, get_first_keyword, get_responses_for_first_keyword, choose_response) assist in the response selection process.

The main function initializes an instance of the Chatbot class and continuously prompts the user for input until they type 'bye'.

The additional functionality that I added includes:
	A large variety of conversation options
	The ability to list keywords by saying 'help'
