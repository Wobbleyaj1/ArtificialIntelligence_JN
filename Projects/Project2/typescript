Artificial Life Simulation of Game of Life
Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by loneliness.
Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
Each cell that ages over 10 generations dies.

How many generations would you like to simulate? 5

Functions:


main():
        Prints an overview of the rules of the Game of Life.
        Prompts the user to specify the number of generations to simulate.
        Parses command-line arguments to handle file input.
        Generates a random map or reads the map from an input file.
        Prints the initial map
        Simulates the specified number of generations, printing the evolution of the colony after each generation.

read_file_input(file_path): This function reads the input file and returns a two-dimensional list representing the map.
	Parameters: 
	-file_path: A string representing the path to the input file.
	Returns:
	-A two-dimensional list representing the map.
	
generate_random_map(rows, cols): This function generates a random map of the specified dimensions.
	Parameters:
	-rows: An integer representing the number of rows in the map.
	-cols: An integer representing the number of columns in the map.
	Returns:
	-A two-dimensional list representing the random map.

apply_rules(current_state, num_neighbors): This function applies the rules of the Game of Life to determine the next state of a cell.
	Parameters:
	-current_state: A string representing the current state of the cell ('X' for alive, '0' for dead).
	-num_neighbors: An integer representing the number of neighboring cells that are alive.
	Returns:
	-A string representing the next state of the cell ('X' for alive, '0' for dead).

detect_neighboring_X(map_data): This function detects neighboring 'X's in the map and updates the map for the next generation according to the rules of the Game of Life.
	Parameters:
	-map_data: A two-dimensional list representing the current map.
	Returns:
	-neighboring_X: A list of tuples containing the coordinates of cells with 'X' and their neighboring 'X's.
	-next_generation_map: A two-dimensional list representing the map for the next generation.
