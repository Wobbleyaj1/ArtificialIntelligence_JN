(a) The Sudoku board is being implemented using a two dimensional vector named Grid. The characters in this vector are obtained through pulling rows from an input file.

(b) The keyword 'protected' allows subclasses to utilize a method or property while 'private' only allows access to the class.

(c) I found four base cases. 1) check if the grid exists. 2) When it finishes filling in all values. 3) When it finds a successful value. 4) If unsuccessful in finding a value for a location.

(d) It checks all values for a cell and when by recursively calling itself to explore the possible solutions for the puzzle. If the call doesn't lead to a solution it resets the cell to its original value. It will get exponentially slower the larger the puzzle gets.

(e) The neural network understands the cells in the 9x9 Sudoku grid as a graph with nodes that could communicate with each other. To train the model, the researchers generated a dataset containing 216,000 puzzles of varying difficulty. The puzzles were all solved and split into a training, validation and test set.
