state(w,e,w,e) #Farmer returns to west bank
state(e,e,e,e) #Farmer takes goat to east bank

c.

Back tracking is a technique used to continue finding a solution when a dead end is hit. When a dead end or invalid state in this case is reached, backtracking is used to return to a state that doesn't lead to that state.
